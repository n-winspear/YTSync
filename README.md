# YTSync

### Description

This project was built to help my partner and I sync up our YouTube watching without the classic 3...2...1...play and without having to use the adfilled websites that are already out there.

This project was also a great way for me to learn the NextJS framework, new REDIS-OM functionality, improve my React skills, and work with some API's that I haven't worked with before, namely the YouTube API.

The application can be found at https://yts-sync.vercel.app/
